Now that I'm back home in Costa Rica after my stay in Germany and look backwards I feel really thankful with such a great organisation.

During this period in Germany I have learned so much in different aspects of my life. Getting familiar with the german culture, seeing different cities and traditions was really nice. I enjoyed a lot walking in different streets and see parks crowded with people enjoying life outdoors. I enjoyed a lot to see how creative people are here in many ways. You can find many galleries. You can see interesting decorations of flats, bars or offices. And you can see a lot of street art and musicians.

I had the chance to drink bavarian beer at the [Oktoberfest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSTY-Aan7Q0), to see a whole city dress up with funny costumes for days at the [Cologne Carnival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiG02T6K6kQ), to see thousands of balloons at the [Lichtgrenze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1F72OGWMDQ) for the 25th Anniversary of the Fall of the Berlin Wall and many other things.

Also, I gained a lot of patient after moving and living in 8 different flats. At first it was hard and frustrating moving so much but now I am really happy since I was able to explore different neighbourhoods of Berlin. This is quite a big thing in this city due how different places can be to each other.

I learned a lot in my job with a startup. Me as a software developer can say the quality of my software is a lot better thanks to all the process and tools I used here. Being expose to german working culture was an enriching experience.

Exploring the city with new friends, learning about the big history of Berlin and dancing deep house are just a few of the things that made my stay here memorable. The synergy generated by AIESEC teams around the word to help people have these experiences is amazing.
