I came here for work for two months in winter. Well you can imagine how it went.

When i first knew I was coming I was positive I will deal with it with no problem. The first thing that crossed my mined mind when I stepped out of the airport was the \"Smell\". I call it now the small of cold, it is like for some reason i can smell the cold, maybe is the snow or something. I dont really know. It is crazy, this smell instantly brought me memories of when I was in Norway. They were certainly nice memories. In just five minutes i started thinking a lot about my time in Norway. This small triggered many thing in my brain and i felt definitely excited
