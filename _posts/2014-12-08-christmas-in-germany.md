It has been really interesting to see how christmas is lived here in Germany. One of the most common activities of the season is going to the Christmas Markets to drink <em>Glühwein</em> (Mulled wine ), which is a typical drink made with red wine along with other spices and is served hot or warm.

During the whole year most people told me I had to go to these markets if am still here during December. I can see now it is really popular. Some markets even have some fun fairs where kids can find different rides. You can also buy candy, crafts and food among other things. Just Berlin has many of this markets. It is a common tradition for families and friends to go there to drink or eat something.

I have always thought Germans are really active and outdoors people and to see these markets always full and crowded confirms this idea. It is really nice that even with these cold temperatures typical of the season, they are willing to spend some hours outdoors.

Another interesting fact is that Christmas is a bit different even inside Germany. For instance, a friend from Brandenburg (the east) told me that their typical Christmas songs are different to the ones in the west. She also told me it is common for her and her friends to gather around and sing all together (but this is maybe a bit particular since they have a musical background).

Another example is that the presents are brought to the kids on Christmas eve by <em>Weihnachtsmann</em> (Santa Claus) in the north and by an angel in the south of the country. This because the south of Germany (Bayern) is usually more religious.

Even though it was pretty much freezing for me; I feel lucky I had the chance to visit some of these markets and drink <em>Glühwein.</em>
