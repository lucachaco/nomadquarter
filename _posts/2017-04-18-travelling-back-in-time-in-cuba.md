I just came back from Cuba and want to write right aways since I still have everything fresh in my mind. Everything
in the trip was perfect except both delayed flights with Cubana de Aviación airline.


<p>
    Once in Cuba I went through migration quite quickly but when I was about to step out of the airport a security agent
    called me to asked some extra questions about the reasons of my travel. I am not sure if he called me because I was
    travelling alone or because I was the first one in my flight about to exit the airport. Anyway after clearing the
    questions I met a guy from Peru who had been living in Costa Rica the last 4 years, we talked a bit, then went to
    exchange money and we shared a taxi. The taxi asked for 30 CUC and we lowered the price to 25 CUC but am sure if I
    had tried I could easily have gotten a ride for 20 CUC.
</p>

<p>
    On the way to the Hostel the taxi driver told us Havana is really safe and that we should not worry about that while
    here. Time will prove he couldn't have been more right. The taxi driver drop my Peruvian friend at his hostel and
    then he drove me to mine. When I got there everybody was out because it was almost 11pm so I decided to walk around
    to take a look. I ended up walking for 2 hours on the Malecón from Havana Centro until Vedado. There were many
    people mostly cuban hanging out in the Malecón, some of them singing, some drinking, some dancing, some just
    talking. It looks like it is a popular place for gathering. While walking here I realized the taxi driver was right
    about safety. At the beginning I felt a bit nervous in the dark streets this late in the night but then I realized
    nobody really look at you and I never had any problem. It was quite the opposite. When I asked for information or
    help cubans were super nice to answer any question.
</p>
<p>
    After walking for 2 hours I decided to get a Taxi back to my hostel. My tiny dorm room had 8 bunk beds but was quote
    fresh. I slept very well and was a really good price. I payed just 10 USD per night when average you usually pay 35
    USD in Cuba. I recommend this hostel (Mirella) specially for meeting people if you travel alone. But it will be
    after next day I will meet other travellers and had a fantastic evening with them but first I will write about my
    first day sightseeing during the day in Havana.
</p>
<p>
    Next morning I went to buy some water to a small shop and then walk to Havana Vieja. I took some pictures of the
    capitol and Havana theater and then jumped on the Hop on Hop off bus. I recommend this bus which is only 10 USD
    since you can see a lot of the city. It rides on most of the Malecón and then goes all the way to Miramar. It passes
    by all the landmarks of the city including Plaza de la revolución. I decided to ride all the way back to Havana
    Vieja and get off at Plaza San Francisco since I wanted to explore more carefully Havana Vieja. I got some good
    lunch for around 20 USD but as I travelled more in cuba I will realized this will be the most expensive meal of my
    trip. Cuba is really inexpensive in my opinion. After I finish I got on the bus again and ride back until Plaza de
    la revolución where I took some pictures and from there I walked to my hostel passing by the University of Havana.
</p>
<p>
    Once in the hostel there were some people hanging out and they were talking about going to el Cañonazo. We went
    there by GuaGua (local buses). Then we found a really cheap place where you can have a beer and pizza for less than
    2 USD. After that we bought some rum and soda to make our own Cuba libre and we walk to el Malecón to drink it. We
    spent most of the rest of the evening there. We met a couple of cubans and one of them told me his brother had been
    in Costa Rica working on his way to USA where he is currently working.

<p>
    The group I was with were planning to go to Playas del Este next day. These are some beaches near Havana just like
    40 mins away but I already had plans to go to Trinidad next day.
</p>

<p>
    Next morning I got a taxi to Viazul bus terminal where I was hoping to get a ticket to Trinidad. Since it had sold
    out I had to wait for everybody to check in to try to find any remaining tickets. Thankfully I got a ticket so I got
    really happy. It was just 25 USD for a 7 hours ride. Trinidad is more than 300 kms away from Havana. In the bus I
    met two Costa Ricans who told they had attended a performance in the theater and that it was worth. So I decided to
    do that when I got back to Havana. In the bus I mostly slept and enjoyed the scenery. I noticed it was really dry
    and flat but as we got closer to the coast I was amazed by the turquoise water. Since It was april it was normal to
    see everything dry since they don't get much rain during this time of the year. I couldn't wait to get to trinidad
    and hopefully a nearby beach. But I will write about that in my next post.
